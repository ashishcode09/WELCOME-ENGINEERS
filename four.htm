<h1>Abey yaar, recall Raju from 3 Idiots? If he can land a job, so can you. 
Believe in yourself, be confident. ðŸŒŸ Revise, revise, and don't forget to prep your mega project.
For placements, it's not just about coding; your project is crucial, especially for on-campus opportunities.       

So, 4th year dude! It's your time to shine, make yourself proud, bhai! ðŸ’ª
Explore off-campus and on-campus options, apply everywhere. Don't wait for companies; 
you have to apply in bulk, go get it! ðŸŽ‰ Create your project; don't copy, but if you're using someone's project, 
make sure you understand it inside out.

Solve some aptitude problems, practice them â€“ because bhai! You'll only sit for an interview if you pass the test.ðŸ“š
Spend 30 minutes reading about the company, understand their vision before stepping into any interview.
It will make a difference.

            <h1> The mere sense of living ðŸŒˆ is joy enough ! </h1>
<pre> <h4> <i> ~ Always follow your heart, my friend. And oh, the memories of hostel food, 
they'll stay with you forever. Remember, these are the crucial moments of your life; don't just rush through
like it's a never-ending race. Babu Moshaye, it's a race that never truly ends. 
Sometimes, it's better not to participate and simply savor life. 
No one else can define your limits; only you can. Don't feel compelled to match someone else's pace; set your own.
This is your life; don't be someone else; just be you!
Wishing you a life filled with happiness and prosperity ahead."</i></h4>
